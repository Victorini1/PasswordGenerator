# PasswordGenerator

## Objectives

This assignment was meant to create the javascript code to create a randomized password generator that wrote an individualized password to the user interface in the browser. By using functions and for loops, I was able to have seperate arrays merge and have individual items from those arrays randomized to create a brand new string of characters to be used in the password. The user is able to select the length preferred and allow which type of characters to include to the password.
